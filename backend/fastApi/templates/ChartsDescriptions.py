linewithDataChart = """
     This chart is a line chart designed to display trends over time with precision and simplicity. 
     It features a straight-line stroke style, dual color-coded series for clear comparison, 
     and labeled data points for enhanced readability. 
     The x-axis represents categories (e.g., time or months), 
     while the y-axis measures quantitative values within a defined range.
     The chart avoids zooming and toolbars to maintain a static and focused visualization, 
     with responsive adjustments for smaller screens. 
     It’s ideal for showing continuous data trends or comparisons between two datasets across a 
     shared dimension.
"""

basicColumChart = """
  This chart is a vertical bar chart designed to compare multiple datasets across categorical 
  dimensions. It features rounded bar endings, a moderate column width for balanced spacing,
  and vibrant color distinctions for each dataset. The x-axis displays categories, 
  while the y-axis represents quantitative values with a focus on
  financial metrics (e.g., amounts in thousands). The chart avoids data labels for simplicity 
  but uses strokes to define bar edges clearly. Its design emphasizes comparison and proportional 
  representation, making it suitable for visualizing grouped or stacked data like performance
  metrics or revenue distributions.
"""

dashedLineChart = """
  This chart is a line chart with dashed line styling, designed to depict trends over 
  time with multiple datasets. It employs straight-line strokes with varying widths and
  dash patterns to visually differentiate series. The x-axis represents sequential 
  categories (e.g., dates), while the y-axis showcases quantitative metrics. 
  Markers are disabled for a cleaner look but enlarge on hover for interactivity.
  Its design is tailored for comparing distinct yet related datasets,
  making it suitable for time-series analysis where visibility of individual
  trends and their relative behaviors is critical.
"""

columnlabelChart = """
  This chart is a vertical bar chart designed to represent a single dataset with 
  labeled data points displayed directly above the bars for clarity. 
  It features a gradient fill for visual enhancement and uses top-aligned x-axis
  labels for a compact and modern layout. The y-axis labels are hidden,
  simplifying the design while retaining percentage-based values for context
  through tooltips and data labels. This format is ideal for displaying
  categorized data with precise values, emphasizing clarity and a clean presentation,
  such as monthly trends or performance metrics.
"""

barChart = """
  This chart is a horizontal bar chart, showcasing a single dataset where each 
  bar represents a specific category. The bars extend horizontally, making it ideal
  for comparing values across categories with long labels, such as country names. 
  The x-axis indicates the values, while the y-axis lists the categories, 
  ensuring readability for text-heavy data. This format is particularly suited for
  ranking or distribution comparisons, such as population sizes, sales figures,
  or other measurable metrics across distinct groups. The clean design with no data
  labels enhances its simplicity and focus on the comparative aspect.
"""

lineColumAreaChar = """
  This chart combines multiple visualization types—line, column, and area—in a single
  representation to provide a comprehensive overview of distinct data series over a
  shared time-based x-axis. It is particularly well-suited for comparing trends,
  distributions, and specific points of interest across datasets with varying visual
  characteristics. By employing smooth curves, dynamic gradients, and precise styling
  for each type of series, it effectively balances clarity and detail, making it ideal
  for multi-faceted data analysis.
"""

simplePieChart = """
  This chart provides a proportional representation of categorical data as segments
  of a pie, highlighting the relative contribution of each category to the whole.
  Its clean and simple layout, combined with customizable colors and a responsive
  design, makes it ideal for presenting data distributions in an intuitive and
  visually appealing manner. It emphasizes clarity and is suitable for quick
  comparisons of parts-to-whole relationships.
"""

splineAreaChart = """
  This chart visualizes data trends over time using smooth, flowing area curves that emphasize
  changes in values while maintaining a focus on the cumulative impact of the data. The use of
  smooth strokes and clean axes ensures a visually appealing representation, ideal for
  showcasing patterns, fluctuations, or progressions in continuous datasets with a
  time-based dimension.
"""

donutChart = """
  This chart model is a circular visualization designed to represent proportions as distinct
  segments of a whole, emphasizing a comparative distribution between categories.
  It includes a centered legend with a dynamic layout that adapts to smaller screens
  by reducing height and hiding the legend. The segments are color-coded for clear
  differentiation, and the layout ensures readability and accessibility on various devices.
"""

basicRadialBarChart = """
  This chart model is a radial bar visualization used to depict progress or performance
  metrics in a circular format, where each bar extends radially from the center.
  It features customizable data labels for category names, values, and an optional
  total summary displayed at the center. The design emphasizes clarity with distinct
  colors for each segment and a layout optimized for presenting proportional values
  or cumulative metrics in a visually engaging way.
